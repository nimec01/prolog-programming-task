# The two include options control if and how the hidden definitions and definitions from the task description should be included into the submission.
# 'yes': include as is,

#    - For hidden definitions all clauses for predicate pred/k are filtered out if the input program also contains clauses for pred/k,
#    - For task definitions clauses that occur identically in the input program are filtered out
# 'no': do not include (only available for includeTaskDefinitions).

# setting for code analysis;
# The status field for each aspect has the following possible values:
# 'ignore': aspect is ignored
# 'hint': detections are reported with severity hint
# 'warn': detections are reported with severity warn
# 'reject': programs with detections are rejected
# The default value for these fields is 'ignore' (in which case the aspect's mention can be omitted as well).

#   singletonVariables:
#     # what to do concerning detection of singleton variables
#     status: ignore
#   cutUsage:
#     # what to do concerning detection of cut usage
#     status: ignore
#     # additional message to display next to default feedback
#     # additionalMessage: "We didn't introduce this operator yet."
#     # This field is only allowed to appear when status is not set to 'ignore', and even otherwise it is optional.
