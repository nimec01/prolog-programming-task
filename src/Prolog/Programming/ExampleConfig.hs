/*
 * This is also part of the program, but is not presented to the student.
 *
 * Be careful to avoid naming clashes to not confuse the student with error messages about code they can't see.
 * Clashes can be avoided by the 'filtered' include setting, but giving priority to the student's version of some
 * predicate can weaken the test suite.
 *
 * If a data constructor or constant begins with hidden__ then it will not be visible in feedback resulting from query tests.
 * The results containing these constructors/constants still need to appear in the list of expected results.
 * When the difference between the expected and actual query result contains only solutions with hidden data a special error message
 * informs the student that their submission is not general enough (in the sense that its rules do not work for arbitrary data).
 *
 * Note that derivation trees are currently not subject to filtering of hidden data!
